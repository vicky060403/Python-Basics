    "- Interpreted Languages\n",
    "  - In interpreted languages, the source code is translated and executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime.\n",
    "  - It is generally slower than compiled languages because it translates the program line by line during execution.\n",
    "  - It reports errors at runtime, which makes debugging easier.\n",
    "  - It is platform-independent, as the interpreter handles system-specific details.\n",

    "- Compiled Languages\n",
    "  - In compiled languages, the entire source code is translated into machine code by a program called a compiler before execution.\n",
    "  - It is generally faster than interpreted languages since it runs directly as machine code.\n",

    "  - 2. Handling Multiple Exceptions in a Single Block:\n",

    "- Multithreading:\n",
    "  - Multithreading is a programming and execution model that allows multiple threads (smaller units of a process) to execute concurrently within the same process.\n",
    "  - A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be independently scheduled and executed by the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In multithreading, multiple threads share the **same memory space within a single process**. Threads are lighter weight than processes and share resources more easily.\n",
    "  - Used for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file I/O, network calls, waiting for user input).\n",
    "  - Parallelism is Limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) — only one thread executes Python code at a time.That's why it is true concurrently.\n",
    "  - Low memory usage, since threads share data.\n",
    "  - A crash in one thread can affect the entire process.\n",
    "  - Communication is easier, since threads share same memory.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        import threading\n",
    "        import requests\n",
    "        urls = [\n",

    "\n",
    "        print(\"All downloads completed!\")\n",
    "- Multiprocessing:\n",
    "  - Multiprocessing is a programming and execution model that involves the concurrent execution of multiple processes.\n",
    "  - A process is an independent program that runs in its own memory space and has its own resources.\n",
    "  - In multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space and resources. And processes are independent of each other.\n",
    "  - It allows for true parallelism, enabling multiple processes to run simultaneously on multiple CPU cores. This leads to improved performance and faster execution of tasks.\n",
    "  - Higher memory usage, since each process has its own memory.\n",
    "  - Communication is Harder — requires inter-process communication (IPC).\n",
    "  - A crash in one process does not affect others.\n",

    "  - 5. **Easier Maintenance**: Logs help developers understand the program’s behavior without reproducing bugs manually.\n",
    "  - 6. **Helps in Monitoring and Auditing**: Logs are used to monitor system health, performance, and security-related activities (e.g., login attempts, API calls).\n",

    "- 1. Efficient Use of Memory:\n",
    "  - Memory is a limited resource.\n",

    "  - Helps applications run faster and smoother without consuming unnecessary system resources.\n",
    "- 2. Prevents Memory Leaks:\n",
    "  - A memory leak occurs when memory is allocated but never released.\n",
    "  - Python’s automatic garbage collector reclaims unused memory, preventing leaks and keeping programs stable.\n",
    "- 3. Improves Program Performance:\n",
    "  - Efficient memory handling means Python can reuse freed-up space for new objects.\n",
    "  - This reduces the load on the system and improves overall execution speed.\n",
    "- 4. Simplifies Development:\n",
    "  - Python’s automatic memory management (via reference counting and garbage collection) removes the need for manual allocation and deallocation (unlike in C/C++).\n",
    "  - Developers can focus on writing logic instead of managing memory manually.\n",
    "- 5. Prevents Crashes and Errors:\n",

    "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "- Python's garbage collection system work as follow:\n",
    "  - 1. Automatic Memory Management:\n",
    "    - Python allocates memory when you create objects (like lists, strings, etc.).\n",
    "    - When objects are no longer needed, Python’s garbage collector automatically frees that memory — no manual deletion required.\n",
    "  - 2. Reference Counting (Primary Mechanism):\n",
    "    - Every object in Python keeps track of how many references point to it.\n",
    "    - This count is stored in an internal counter (ob_refcnt).\n",
    "    - When the reference count drops to zero, the memory for that object is immediately reclaimed.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "          import sys\n",
    "          x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "          print(sys.getrefcount(x))  # Shows how many references point to x\n",
    "\n",
    "  - 3. Problem: Circular References:\n",
    "    - Sometimes, two or more objects reference each other, creating a cycle —\n",
    "    - their reference counts never reach zero, even if they are unused.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "          class A:\n",
    "              def __init__(self):\n",
    "                  self.other = None\n",
    "\n",
    "          a1 = A()\n",
    "          a2 = A()\n",
    "          a1.other = a2\n",
    "          a2.other = a1  # circular reference\n",
    "  - 4. Garbage Collector for Cyclic References:\n",
    "    - Python’s gc module handles this.\n",
    "    - It periodically scans for circular references that are no longer reachable from the main program.\n",
    "    - When found, it deletes them safely.\n",
    "  - 5. Generational Garbage Collection:\n",
    "    - Python divides objects into three generations based on their age (how many GC cycles they’ve survived):\n",
    "    - Generation 0: Newly created objects (collected most frequently)\n",
    "    - Generation 1: Survived one collection\n",
    "    - Generation 2: Survived multiple collections (collected least often).\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "          import gc\n",
    "          gc.collect()  # Manually triggers garbage collection\n",
    "\n",
    "  - 6. Developer Control:\n",
    "    - You can interact with the garbage collector using the gc module:\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "          import gc\n",
    "          gc.enable()      # Turn GC on (default)\n",
    "          gc.disable()     # Turn GC off\n",
    "          gc.collect()     # Force garbage collection\n",
    "          print(gc.get_stats())  # View collection stats\n"

    "- Although Python provides automatic memory management through reference counting and garbage collection, there are still some challenges and limitations developers should be aware of.\n",
    "- Challenges:\n",
    "  - 1. Circular References\n",
    "    - Python uses reference counting to free memory.\n",
    "    - If two or more objects reference each other (a cycle), their reference counts never reach zero.\n",
    "    - While the garbage collector can detect cycles, it may not immediately free memory, causing temporary memory bloat.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "          class Node:\n",
    "              def __init__(self):\n",

    "          b.ref = a  # Circular reference\n",
    "  - 2. Memory Leaks in Long-Running Programs\n",
    "    - If objects are kept referenced unintentionally, they cannot be garbage collected.\n",
    "    - Over time, this can lead to increased memory usage and performance degradation.\n",
    "    - Example: Caching large data structures without cleanup.\n",
    "  - 3. Inefficient Use of Memory\n",
    "    - Python objects have overhead (metadata, reference counters, dynamic typing).\n",
    "    - Small objects or large collections can consume more memory than expected.\n",
    "  - 4. Unpredictable Garbage Collection\n",
    "    - The garbage collector runs periodically, not instantly.\n",
    "    - This can cause unpredictable memory usage spikes in memory-intensive applications.\n",
    "  - 5. Interfacing with C Extensions\n",
    "    - When using C extensions or libraries like NumPy, Python’s garbage collector may not track memory allocated in C.\n",
    "    - Developers need to manage this memory manually to prevent leaks.\n",
    "  - 6. Multithreading Issues\n",
